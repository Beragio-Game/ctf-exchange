# Beragio CTF Exchange

## Background

The Beragio CTF Exchange is an exchange protocol that facilitates atomic swaps between [Conditional Tokens Framework(CTF)](https://docs.gnosis.io/conditionaltokens/) ERC1155 assets and an ERC20 collateral asset.

It is intended to be used in a hybrid-decentralized exchange model wherein there is an operator that provides offchain matching services while settlement happens on-chain, non-custodially.
